HOMER, THE ODYSSEY, TRANSLATED BY Robert Fagles
Book ONE
Athena Inspires the Prince
Sing to me of the man. Muse, the man of twists and turns ...
driven time and again off, course, once he had plundered
the hallowed heights of Troy.
Many cities, of men, he saw, and learned, their minds,
many pains, he suffered, heartsick, on the open sea,
fighting to save his life, and bring his comrades home.
But he could not save them from disaster, hard as he strove,
the recklessness of their own ways, destroyed them all,
the blind fools, they devoured the cattle of the Sun,
and the Sungod, blotted out the day of their return.
Launch out on his story, Muse, daughter of Zeus,
start from where you will, sing for our time too.
By now, all the survivors, all who avoided headlong death,
were safe at home, escaped the wars and waves.
, But one man,, alone ...
his heart set on his wife and his return,,, Calypso,
the bewitching nymph, the lustrous goddess,
held him back, deep in her arching caverns,
crayving him for a husband.
But then, when the wheeling seasons brought the year around,
, that year, spun out, by the gods,
when he should reach, his home,,
, Ithaca, though, not even there would he be free of trials,
even among,, his loved ones,,, then,, every god, took pity,
all except Poseidon. He raged on,
seething against the great Odisyus,
till he reached his native land.
