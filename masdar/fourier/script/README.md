The files here are mostly just little things I made to automate my process, aside from [get-points.js](get-points.js) which is what I used to get a list of points from an SVG. I literally just... open the SVG in a browser and copy paste that into the debug terminal :P

You're welcome to read the other files too if you're curious, they're not secret! Part of this is the script I use this to fork from my base project for web stuff, [es6-base](https://github.com/Jezzamonn/es6-base)
