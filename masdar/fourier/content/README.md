Hello! Welcome to the GitHub repository for [jezzamon.com/fourier](http://www.jezzamon.com/fourier)! This folder, [content/](.) is where the content of the page is defined!

The content of the page is written in Markdown. That file gets converted into HTML when the website is built in [script/make-html.js](../script/make-html.js)).

If you are interested in creating a new translation, you can create a new .md file here for that language! The process involves:

1. Make a copy of [content.md](content.md).
1. Change all the English parts into another language. See [content-es.md](content-es.md) for an example.
   - If you could also create a translation of the title, that'd be great!
1. Either email the file to me (fourier@jezzamon.com), or send a pull request with the updated file and I'll get it on the website!

Please also make sure to credit yourself! Feel free to add a section at the end of the article.
